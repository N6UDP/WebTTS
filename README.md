# Web TTS

This is a simple ASP.NET application that wraps Windows system.speech APIs to allow a user to output TTS to any audio device.

## Usage

1. Run the binary
2. Open a browser to the specified address
3. (Optional) Use a virtual audio cable ([VAC Lite](https://vac.muzychenko.net/en/download.htm), [VB](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)) as the output device
4. Configure your software of choice to use the virtual audio cable as it's input device

## Example Usage

Open the URL in your Steam overlay and point Discord at the virtual audio device to TTS at your friends.
